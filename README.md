# shopping_cart
This is very basic project which I made while learning C++.
In this I have tried to implement few concepts of c++ like methods()/function, some local directories(time.h and etc), also to make our code a little different I have added special symbols to give color scheme to our code and many more exiting things.
Fell free to have a glance in my code :)
